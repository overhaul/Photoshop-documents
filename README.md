# About Overhaul

* * *


Overhaul is self-funded. We haven't ever brought in outside financing. Since our earliest days this has been incredibly important in providing freedom to shape the company and its business practices.

## Overhaul Objectives

a) Better empower clients to be confident and self-sustaining. 

b) Create great work.

c) No stress / no headaches (ok, very little/few).

d) Make work enjoyable.

e) Become FAST EASY and EFFICIENT.

f) Pay everyone a fair salary, as much as we can really while being responsible. 

g) Become proactive for our retainer clients (haven, drivewyze) through check in's and constant improvements (within budget).

h) Backup statements we make in; proposals, estimating process, presentations, our website, ultimately our work and reputation.

We are entirely self-funded, with no outside investors, and no debt. We are paid for our time and skills both on a time and materials basis as well as a value-driven model.

Sustainability of the company is very important to us. We want to bring great people on at reasonable salaries and reward them as aggressively as possible for actual performance.

We may never be able to compete dollar for dollar with other companies in a similar space but we can compete on being a great place to work, with lots of opportunities to learn, and the freedom to define and execute on our own projects.

# Estimating

* * *


See PERT and link templated version. Also need some of the logic in MJ's head around valuing clients. 

# Contracts/Agreements

* * *


Link to agreement templates in Google Drive

# Maintenance

* * *


We're currently working on outlining this service more both to sell and to automate as much of it as possible.

# Administrative stuff

* * *


## When you're away

Lucky you, getting some r&r huh.. well be sure to set your email-away message stating when you'll be back and who to contact in your absence.

## When you have nothing to do.

Update/Improve our portfolio/website, clean up your desk. Clean up someone else's desk, go buy supplies, take a break.

## When you answer the phone

Be polite and get name, phone number.

**When you greet someone in the office** 

Seat in board room and offer water or beverage. Ask who they're here to see and notify that person.

## Payday

Pay is processed on the 27th of each month. If your timesheet is not correct on the 27th there is going to be some issues to sort out. Cheques arrive within a couple of days for you.

Each cheque is time accrued from the 28th to the 27th

## Benefits

Active after 3 month probation period. They're through Great West Life. If you don't have the little green book. Ask about it. 

## Hours

While people occasionally choose to push themselves to work some extra hours at times when something big is going out the door, for the most part working overtime for extended periods indicates a fundamental failure in planning or communication. If this happens at Overhaul, it's a sign that something needs to be reevaluated and corrected. If you're looking around wondering why people aren't in "crunch mode," the answer's pretty simple. The thing we work hardest at is hiring good people, so we want them to stick around and have a good balance between work and family and the rest of the important stuff in life. If you find yourself working long hours, or just generally feel like that balance is out of whack, be sure to raise the issue with whomever you feel would help.

## Overtime

TBD

## Unplanned Sick Days / Missing Work

Message the team (or call someone) and let them know you'll be away. If possible, let them know what you were working on, if anything is urgent, meetings that need to be cancelled etc. 

## Email etiquette

These shouldn't be quick text messages. Use the phone a lot but know when to switch to email, that's typically when you need approvals, include other people (cc), details or a paper trail. They should be polite and addressed to the recipient. (e.g. Hey John,) Always have a signature.

 

Be mindful of email subjects and searchability, you never know when you'll need to pull information from a 2 year old email thread and nothing makes it harder than not having anything useful to search by. 

## Team member birthdays

Try remember them. 

There should be a shared calendar of birthdays. If you haven't seen it, ask. 

## Meetings (in or out of office)

Prep, be ready and early. Clean out the board room if needed.

Be set up with coffee, water files on screen, hangout/skype/gotomeeting setup in advance. 

Files should be prepped for the users screen (macbook, 5k iMac etc) or boardroom screen. 

## Time off & stat holidays.

Each employee receives 2 paid weeks vacation. 4% is added to all of your cheques after the 3 months probation is complete. 

The rest is not paid but it is possible to get more time off. 

Stay holidays - these are pretty standard. They're paid at your normal rate if not worked and paid time and a half if you work them.

## The Office

# Expectations

* * *


## Fast and Smart

The more we can build and learn from the better our products will become. The digital world changes faster than ever so why spend forever perfecting something to have it rendered obsolete just as soon as it's finished. 

**Rule**: Use good judgement in all situations!

# Projects

* * *


What to do if you think you're going to miss a deadline. Communicate! Email, call text your project manager. 

No project in harvest - you use 'to allocate' and note who the project is for. If it's small it probably won't get a full on project but wouldn't hurt to ask your project manager. 

No flow project - you should be able to create a new one but please name it properly and invite the rest of the team. If you're not sure, ask.

No project (docket) code - Using Harvest Generated Code for now (we're still working on this). 

All project files saved and organized in file share. /omshare 

If you do not have access to this, ask.

# Design Techniques 

* * *


## 1.0 Introduction

The Design Techniques consists of a set of design principles and the techniques to achieve them.

This is a living document, updated as we refine our design approach and process. It is part of a series of guides that define how we do things as a company. 

**Loose high level process for websites** 

> <sub>1. Research

> <sub>2. Outline 

>     1. Define hour goal/budget

>     2. Scope and schedule sprints.

> <sub>3. Creative Brief

> <sub>4. Wire/Sketch

> <sub>5. Design Sprint 1 (defined scope in brief)

> <sub>6. Review

> <sub>7. Design Sprint 2 (usually move into invision here) 

> <sub>8. Review

> <sub>9. Prep Client Presentation

> <sub>10. Revisions (if required) 

> <sub>11. Approval

> <sub>12. Prep assets for development team 

## 2.0 File organization

At Overhaul we believe that clarity and order should not only be applied to our design work but also to our internal file organization.

Missing files, lost typefaces and folders that are not properly sorted can become a problem. A decent file organization helps designers and developers to easily share files between each other and it helps you to find your way much faster through any archived files from years back.

> <sub>* Standardized place (url or folder) where the most recent mockups can be viewed for developing.

**General file handling**

The following file naming rules apply:

> <sub>* File names should be lowercase: "01b-fair-landing-diaporama.png". → This creates a consistent and clean URL when sharing files and in a linux environment. Exceptions can be made for company names like "Trump" and "IBM" or specific terms like "iPad" etc.

> <sub>* Replace spaces in filenames with underscores "-".

> <sub>* Names should be grouped by dashes: "maison-et-objet_design_01.ai" instead of "maison_et_objet_design_01.ai".

Shish Kabob style no underscores or spaces in filenames!

> <sub>* File names should be short: "mo-home-v1.ai" instead of "maison-et-objet_homepage_design_01.ai" or simply "home_01.ai" if there is already a folder with the client name "maison-et-objet".

> <sub>* Design files should be named by section (homepage, landing page, …) 

> <sub>* Older files get archived into /old/trash folders to not clutter up folders.

**Folder Structure** 

> <sub>* The folder structure should be as flat as possible, the less folders in folders, the better! Empty folders get deleted. 

client/website/ (for long term clients we add in a year. E.g. /client/2017/websiteproject/ ) 

client/website/01_working/wireframes

client/website/02_assets/

client/website/03_proofs/

client/website/03_proofs/2017-05-11/

client/website/trash/

Client projects are broken down by project type/name

/client/year/projectname/

/client/year/project_update#/

/client/year/businesscards/

/client/year/billboards/

Folders/Files that can be applied across all client projects:

/client/supplied/ (things that came from the client)

/client/fonts/

Project files contain specific files that only pertain to that project.

/client/year/projectname/assets

/client/year/projectname/old

**Versioning**

Most recent file:

/client/year/projectname/01_working/file_v3.jpg

Old files

/client/year/projectname/OLD/file_v1.jpg

/client/year/projectname/OLD/file_v2.jpg

Print specific projects

/client/year/Print/01_working/

/client/year/Print/03_proofs/

/client/year/Print/04_print_final/

**File management**

Each project is split into multiple design rounds:

> <sub>* Design exploration (Initial moodboards, art direction)

> <sub>* Design (Designs to be presented to the client)

> <sub>* Development (Design production and hand off)

Each major design update is saved as a new file with an updated version number.

## Photoshop documents

**Content**

For the love of god, use REAL content wherever possible. Our clients have content we can use, so do so. Using real content will help you understand:

> <sub>* interface gaps

> <sub>* truncation issues

> <sub>* problematic large chunks

> <sub>* missing content

> <sub>* extraneous content

> <sub>* and a whole lot more

You have no excuse now. Go forth and use REAL CONTENT!

**Setup for Retina Mockups**

Mockups should be created at 2× resolution by default. This can make thinking in consistent units hard (2px in PSD == 1px in CSS). The recommended way to ease this pain is to set up Photoshop documents to use pt units in such a way that 1pt in Photoshop equals 1px in CSS:

When creating a new document, set the Resolution to 144px/inch. If updating an existing document, do this in Image > Image Size (make sure Resample is disabled).

Open Photoshop > Preferences > Units and Rulers.

In the Units fieldset, change both Rulers and Type to Points.

In the New Document Preset Resolutions fieldset, change the Screen Resolution to 144px/inch.

In Photoshop > Preferences > Guides, Grid and Slices, Make sure to leave the Gridline and Subdivision settings in pixel units, not points. Using point for snapping is buggy and will lead to errors. Example: if you want gridlines every 8 points, set this value to 16 pixels.

Note: some palettes and inputs (such as Transform) do not respect the unit preferences. However, they do remember the last unit used so as you work in points they will come to reflect the new preferred unit.

**Modules & Linked Smart Objects**

Photoshop CC now supports linked smart objects. Following in the footsteps of InDesign and Illustrator, users can now drop linked files into Photoshop documents. When a linked smart object has been placed in a PSD, Photoshop will detect changes to this linked file and you can update them as needed across all PSD's. This allows us to modularize our elements in a similar fashion to the way our CSS has been modularized.

Please break up your PSD's into logical modules and place these modules as linked smart objects in your PSD's. Here's how to place a linked smart object:

File > Place Linked

I've put together this diagram to help:

![](null)

As far as naming conventions go, for the modular PSD's we'll be following in the same footsteps as the CSS Style Guide and its reference to Component Oriented Naming, and for the non-modular PSD's we'll follow our standard file naming and folder conventions . So click the links and study up.

*This system can get unruly and complicated pretty easily, but its a HUGE help on massive projects with lots of comps. If you're working on a quick small project, you don't HAVE to use this structure, its probably overkill.*

You'll also notice the above diagram has a styleguide.psd. This segues nicely into our next topic:

**Styleguide.psd**

Every project should have its own styleguide.psd file that contains all the elements of a projects interface. This style guide can they be used by developers to create the necessary CSS markup for interface elements, without having to hunt through an entire project's worth of mocks.

As identified by the diagram above, the style guide should actually consist of components that are linked smart objects. This allows us to maintain that the compontent.psd file is the master copy and that updates to it propagate through all their linked PSDs.

Find the template on omshare/templates/*UI Style Guide Template > style-guide-template.psd*

**Paragraph & Character Styles**

A - Margins

Rather than dealing with new type layers, and soft carriage returns, try to setup your typography system using the paragraph and character panels. The Paragraph spacing options allow you to add space before and after paragraphs, super handy for blocks of text!

B - Letter Spacing

Try not to use it, but if you must use increments of 50. Increments of 50 generally translates to 1px + or - but this scales with the font size, so use your judgement.

C - Hyphenation

Since CSS doesn't support hyphenation, make sure hyphenation is turned off in Photoshop as well. Check the Paragraph panel.

![](null)

**Vector Shapes**

Use vector shapes whenever possible. Photoshop CC now supports native non-destructive transform on all vector shapes. So if you make sure you're building rounded rectangles with the rounded rectangle tool you can now adjust those rounded corners in the path panel, even after transforming the rectangle. Finally, Illustrator like vector tools, HOORAH!

**Image Embedding**

We all love embedding our clients sweet photos into image carousels (they send over the best photography!) When you do, make sure the image is embedded at 100% height and 100% width and turn that image into a smart object. Now when you resize to fit, you'll be doing so non-destructively. Smart Objects FTW.

Also good idea to save these into assets ready for the web - scaled, cropped, optimized etc. 

**Colour Profiles**

Make sure you disable colour management in Photoshop. We want our mocks to be easy for developers, and since there are no colour management options in development, we gotta scrap 'em in Photoshop too. To do this:

Edit > Color Settings

![](null)

**Colour Swatches**

When working on a client project, make sure to check the assets folder for a colour swatches panel. Every project should have one, and if it doesn't please create one. Couple things to note here:

> <sub>* name colours using our scss naming syntax

> <sub>* use the swatches present manager to easily manage colour swatches

> <sub>* large list view is great for a list of colours and their titles

![](null)

**Sharp Edges**

Make sure your snap to pixels and grid tools are enabled. We want those pixels to be as sharp as possible, nobody likes soft blurry edges.

**Plugins**

We use a few plugins to increase efficiency and improve our workflows. They are:

> <sub>* [GuideGuide](http://guideguide.me/) - pixel accurate columns, rows, midpoints, and baselines can be created based on your document or selection with the click of a button

> <sub>* [Composer](https://jasonforal.com/composer/) - Update multiple layer comps in Photoshop with just one click

**Layer organization and naming**

Group and label (ideally relatable to the development) your PSD Layers.

Try to keep objects organised by grouping them into multiple layers and sublayers. A decent file organisation helps you not only to establish a proper system for your design, but also to hand-off your files easier and to find your way through archived files much faster.

Keep the folder structure as flat as possible by not creating too many sublayers. This makes it easier to get an immediate overview over your system.

Group elements which appear on every page of your website (header or footer elements) into one single layer either at the top or at the bottom of the panel, rather than duplicating them into every single layer.

Use one document for the whole system if possible (one document = one system). It will make it easier to copy elements from one page to another and share the same libraries (e.g. Swatches and Styles).

Stick to the same file naming and order for your exported files. This makes it easy when exporting layer by layer for a presentation and sharing your files. (See • General file handling for consistent layer naming).

## 3. Grid

Grid-based design is a foundational aspect of Overhaul's design philosophy. Every system we design is based on a grid.

View > New Guide Layout

![](null)

Working with a grid is an essential starting point for any project. It is the controlling principle helping to create an organized graphic system that is tight and easy to understand, while also providing a framework for making design choices.

The grid defines a mathematical system for the design and provides rules for the size and placement of objects within it. The number of possibilities for any given decision is reduced, making it faster to explore and iterate solutions.

For interactive projects we use the Bootstrap 12 column Grid. This makes moving to development easy and no guesswork required.  Makes naming classes for the columns simple and consistent between projects.

> <sub>* Compare devices regarding sizing and resolution on [Google Device Metrics.](https://material.io/devices/)

Example grids for desktop to mobile

## 4. Styles / Style Guides

We do style guides for the majority of our website projects. When a project has a CMS we are always going to need a set of elements (h1, h2, form inputs, buttons, list styles etc).

LINK TO TITAN This reduces the possibility of us missing something a user might make with their CMS tools, also make the site easier to maintain in the future.

## 5. Atomic / Modular design 

Mainly when a project is CMS driven we use a modular design approach. Read more below until I can write more here.
